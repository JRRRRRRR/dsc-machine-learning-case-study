# Scenario
* You are tasked with investigating customer churn
    * churn: when a customer quits a service.  High churn rate = bad for business.
* in the `data/` folder is a the dataset you will be working on. 


# Complete the following
* Find features that are high indicators of churn and build visualizations
* Build a model to predict churn. You can build any model you want including
    * Logistic Regression 
    * KNN
    * Bayesian Classifiers
* Choose an evaluation metric for your model
    * Accuracy vs Precision vs Recall vs F1
* Explain why you chose that Metric
* Apply a GridsearchCV to find the best hyper parameters for your model
* After you build your final model you must have
    * A confusion matrix supporting your model
    * Final Metric Score
* Make sure you have a validation set for your data


# Can you
* Work in groups? Yes
* Ask cohort-mates for help/advice? Yes
* Check what you did with a cohort-mate? Yes
* Ask me for advice? Yes

This is an opportunity to practice some ML before the Phase 3 project. 


## things to remember
* A data scientist is good at finding key insights to problems not just building models
* validate your model with a confusion matrix and have a validation set
